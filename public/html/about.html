    Ongoing project for all things satellite RX related.

    Quick roadmap and some planned features:
       Customized view showcasing most up-to-date global projection, recent posts from stations’ linked socials, recent RXes from stations (possibly filtered by coverage) Records of longest/highest quality pictures
       Search by station name or location
       Showcase of images/composites/group/custom image/etc. along with visualizations of the station stats (can be restricted by the station admin)
       View information about each station, such as location, images of the station, hardware, software, and equipment used, any records this station holds, link to admin’s blog page & socials etc.
       Page that will allow the owner of a station to customize the experience and content for those viewing their station’s page; as well as customizing how the service works on their device.
       
       Some new pages planned to be added are: Wiki, Blog, SatRX News, and maybe even a shop (or at least a database of links to verified posts of SatRX products)
